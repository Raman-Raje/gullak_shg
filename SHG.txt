SHG Information
******************


Database Schema Design
Hereâ€™s a structured approach for your SHG application, divided into key tables with their relevant fields:


**********************************************************
Users Table :- This table stores detailed information about each user.

1. Users Table
--------------
Purpose: Stores detailed information about each user.

CREATE TABLE Users (
    user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    address TEXT,
    phone_number TEXT CHECK (phone_number ~ '^\+?[0-9\s\-()]*$'),
    email TEXT UNIQUE CHECK (email ~* '^[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,}$'),
    image_url TEXT,
    date_of_birth DATE CHECK (date_of_birth <= CURRENT_DATE AND date_of_birth >= '1900-01-01'),
    joining_date DATE CHECK (joining_date <= CURRENT_DATE),
    identification_number VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE,  -- Addhar, PAN, Voter ID
    encrypted_identification_number BYTEA,  -- Encrypted identification number
    emergency_contact TEXT,
    gender VARCHAR(10) CHECK (gender IN ('Male', 'Female', 'Other')),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT current_timestamp
);

CREATE INDEX idx_users_user_id ON Users(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON Users(email);


Policy for users:

-- Enable Row Level Security
ALTER TABLE Users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Policy: Allow users to select their own information
CREATE POLICY select_own_data ON Users
FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Policy: Allow users to update their own information
CREATE POLICY update_own_data ON Users
FOR UPDATE
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Policy: Prevent deletion of user records
CREATE POLICY no_delete ON Users
FOR DELETE
USING (false);

-- Policy: Allow only admins to insert user records
CREATE POLICY insert_user ON Users
FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (exists (
  select 1
  from auth.users
  where id = auth.uid()
  and is_admin = true
));

-- Policy: Allow admins to view users associated with their SHG group
CREATE POLICY admin_view_own_group_users ON Users
FOR SELECT
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM Memberships AS m_admin
    JOIN Memberships AS m_user ON m_admin.group_id = m_user.group_id
    WHERE m_admin.user_id = auth.uid() 
      AND m_admin.role = 'admin' 
      AND m_user.user_id = Users.user_id
  )
);

-- Policy: Allow CRPs to view user information for SHGs they oversee
CREATE POLICY crp_view_own_shg_users ON Users
FOR SELECT
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM Memberships AS m_crp
    JOIN Memberships AS m_user ON m_crp.group_id = m_user.group_id

      AND m_crp.role = 'crp'
      AND m_user.user_id = Users.user_id
  )
);


**********************************************************

SHG Groups Table :- This table manages information about each SHG.

2. Groups Table
------------------
Purpose: Manages information about each SHG.

Table:

CREATE TABLE Groups (
    group_id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    group_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,

    contribution_frequency VARCHAR CHECK (contribution_frequency IN ('monthly', 'quarterly', 'yearly')), -- Contribution frequency
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT current_timestamp
);

policies for Groups Table:

1. Read-Only Access for Users: Regular users can only read information about their SHG group.
2. Full Control for Admins: Admins can manage (insert, update, delete) their SHG group.
3. Restrict access to sensitive columns, such as bank account details, to only admins.

-- Allow members to select only SHGs they belong to
CREATE POLICY member_select ON Groups
FOR SELECT
USING (EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM Memberships
    WHERE group_id = Groups.group_id AND user_id = auth.uid()

          AND m.group_id = Groups.group_id
    )
);

-- View for members (excluding sensitive information)
CREATE VIEW member_groups AS

FROM Groups
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM Memberships
    WHERE group_id = Groups.group_id AND user_id = auth.uid()

TODO: Full access for current viewving SHG only. Need to revice policy
-- Create the view for admins (full access)

3. Loan Disbursement by SHG to Users
------------------------------------
Start: Admin initiates the loan disbursement process.
Verify Loan Approval: System verifies that the loan request is approved.
Create Disbursement Entry: System creates a loan disbursement entry in the Transactions table.
Initiate Payment: System initiates the payment process using Razorpay (if applicable, usually direct bank transfer for disbursements).
Complete Payment: Admin confirms the disbursement.

Loans Table:- This table manages loan-specific information. Tracks loans given to users.

Column Descriptions and Justifications:
---------------------------------------
loan_id: Ensures each loan can be uniquely identified.
group_id: Links the loan to the specific SHG providing it.
user_id: Links the loan to the specific member or admin receiving it.
loan_amount: Captures the principal amount of the loan.
interest_rate: Captures the interest rate, ensuring it is within a valid range.
loan_purpose: Specifies the reason for the loan, providing context for financial management.
loan_status: Tracks the current state of the loan lifecycle.
loan_start_date: Records when the loan was issued.
loan_end_date: Sets the expected completion date of the loan.
repayment_frequency: Ensures the correct scheduling of repayments.
installment_amount: Helps in calculating the regular payment amounts.
remaining_balance: Tracks how much of the loan is still outstanding.
collateral: Records any collateral provided, enhancing the security of the loan.
created_at: Tracks when the loan record was initially created.
updated_at: Tracks the last update to the loan record, important for auditing and management.
